Real-Time Emotion Detection 🎭

A deep learning-based project that performs **real-time facial emotion recognition** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model and **Streamlit** for the interactive frontend.

📌 Overview

This project aims to detect human emotions such as **Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Disgust,** and **Neutral** in real-time from webcam video feed. It leverages a trained CNN model for classifying emotions from grayscale facial images and uses `Streamlit` for building an intuitive web interface.


🚀 Features

- Real-time emotion detection via webcam 📹
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard 📊
- Dataset preprocessing, visualization, and model insights 🧠
- Modular architecture for easy understanding and extensibility 🔧
- Uses Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection 👤

📈 Emotion Labels

The model detects the following 7 emotions:

| Label Index | Emotion   |
|-------------|-----------|
| 0           | Angry     |
| 1           | Disgust   |
| 2           | Fear      |
| 3           | Happy     |
| 4           | Sad       |
| 5           | Surprise  |
| 6           | Neutral   |
